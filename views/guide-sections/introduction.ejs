  <h2>ADA Service Dog Definition</h2>
  <div class="definition-box">
    <p><strong>Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      "A dog that has been <strong>individually trained</strong> to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability. The task(s) performed by the dog must be <strong>directly related</strong> to the person's disability."
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <h3>Critical Points:</h3>
  <ul class="check-list">
    <li>✅ No official certification or registration is required</li>
    <li>✅ You have the legal right to train Gypsy yourself</li>
    <li>✅ The dog must be trained BEFORE being taken into public places</li>
    <li>✅ Emotional support alone does not qualify as a service dog under ADA</li>
    <li>✅ Standard training benchmark: minimum 120-220 hours</li>
  </ul>
