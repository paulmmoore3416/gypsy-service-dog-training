      <h3>1. Watch My Back / Room Clearing</h3>
      <span class="difficulty-badge high">Essential for Hypervigilance</span>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Addresses hypervigilance by having Gypsy monitor areas you can't see, allowing you to relax knowing she's alert to threats.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>Watch My Back Behavior</strong></summary>
        <p>Gypsy positions behind you facing outward, monitoring approach vectors while you focus forward.</p>

        <h4>Training Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Teach "Behind" Position:</strong> Lure her to stand/sit directly behind you between your legs</li>
          <li><strong>Add Outward Focus:</strong> Reward when she faces away from you, watching environment</li>
          <li><strong>Build Duration:</strong> She holds position for increasing time (5 min → 15 min)</li>
          <li><strong>Add Movement:</strong> You walk forward slowly, she maintains rear guard</li>
          <li><strong>Alert Training:</strong> Reward if she alerts you to actual approaches from behind</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Applications:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Waiting in line (checkout, DMV, bank)</li>
          <li>Sitting in waiting rooms</li>
          <li>Public seating with back to open space</li>
          <li>Any time you feel vulnerable from rear</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Room Clearing Behavior</strong></summary>
        <p>Gypsy enters rooms ahead of you and checks space, signaling when clear.</p>

        <h4>Training Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Teach "Check It":</strong> Send her into room first</li>
          <li><strong>Search Pattern:</strong> She walks perimeter, checks corners</li>
          <li><strong>Return Signal:</strong> Comes back to you when search complete</li>
          <li><strong>All Clear:</strong> Sits or looks at you = room is clear</li>
          <li><strong>Alert:</strong> Refuses to enter or maintains alert posture = something unusual</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Applications:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Entering your home after being away</li>
          <li>Hotel rooms</li>
          <li>Public restrooms (send her to check stalls)</li>
          <li>Any new or unfamiliar space</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pitbull Advantage:</h4>
        <p>Natural alertness and protective instincts make pitbulls excellent for detection work. Gypsy's confident demeanor also provides psychological reassurance.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Important Distinction</strong></summary>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">
          <p><strong>This is NOT guard dog training.</strong> Gypsy checks spaces and monitors areas, but never acts aggressively. She provides reassurance through presence and awareness, not protection through aggression.</p>

      <h3>2. Flashback Interruption</h3>
      <span class="difficulty-badge high">Critical PTSD Task</span>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Interrupts dissociative flashback states by providing strong physical and sensory stimuli that ground you in present reality.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>What Happens During Flashbacks</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li>You may appear "frozen" or unresponsive</li>
          <li>Eyes unfocused or seeing through people</li>
          <li>Not responding to name or questions</li>
          <li>Rapid breathing or breath-holding</li>
          <li>Tense body posture</li>
          <li>Facial expression of fear or distress</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Gypsy's Interruption Sequence</strong></summary>
        <h4>Escalating Intervention:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Level 1 - Gentle Alert:</strong> Nose nudge to hand or leg</li>
          <li><strong>Level 2 - Persistent Contact:</strong> Repeated nudging, pawing gently</li>
          <li><strong>Level 3 - Licking:</strong> Licks face or hands (strong sensory input)</li>
          <li><strong>Level 4 - Body Block:</strong> Pushes full body weight against you</li>
          <li><strong>Level 5 - Vocalization:</strong> Quiet whine or single bark</li>
          <li><strong>Level 6 - DPT:</strong> If you're sitting/lying, applies deep pressure</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Training This Sequence:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Simulate State:</strong> Sit or stand motionless, staring into space</li>
          <li><strong>Don't Respond:</strong> Ignore her initial attempts</li>
          <li><strong>Reward Escalation:</strong> Reward when she tries progressively more intense interventions</li>
          <li><strong>"Wake Up" Cue:</strong> After sufficient intervention, suddenly respond with massive reward</li>
          <li><strong>Practice Timing:</strong> Sometimes respond quickly, sometimes require Level 4-5 intervention</li>
          <li><strong>Real Episodes:</strong> When you return from actual flashback and she intervened, heavily reward</li>
        </ol>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Temporal Grounding Additions</strong></summary>
        <p>Teach Gypsy to help you identify current time/place:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Location Marker:</strong> After interruption, she retrieves specific object that represents "home/safety"</li>
          <li><strong>Routine Anchor:</strong> Performs her specific task sequence that only happens in present day</li>
          <li><strong>Physical Presence:</strong> Her modern collar, vest, current smell = not the past</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Veteran Perspective</strong></summary>
        <p>For Marines, flashbacks often involve combat situations. Having Gypsy bring you back is like having a battle buddy who anchors you to the present. Her interruption says: "You're not there anymore. You're here, you're safe, I've got you."</p>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Tactical Positioning Training</strong></summary>
        <h4>"Watch My Six" (Behind Position):</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Lure her to position directly behind you, facing outward</li>
          <li>Add military terminology that feels natural to you</li>
          <li>Build duration - she holds position while you're stationary</li>
          <li>Add movement - maintains position as you walk slowly</li>
          <li>Practice in lines, waiting areas, public spaces</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>"Circle" / Perimeter Check:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Lure her to walk complete circle around you</li>
          <li>Add stops at 4 compass points (pause and look outward)</li>
          <li>Build speed until fluid motion</li>
          <li>Use when entering spaces or feeling vulnerable</li>
          <li>Her check gives you visual confirmation of surroundings</li>
        </ol>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Military Working Dog Connection</strong></summary>
        <p>Many veterans find comfort in these tasks because they mirror military working dog behaviors. Gypsy becomes your "battle buddy" in civilian life, maintaining perimeter awareness so you can focus forward.</p>

        <p><strong>Psychological Benefit:</strong> Instead of constantly scanning for threats yourself (hypervigilance), you can delegate some of that awareness to Gypsy. Over time, this can reduce hypervigilance symptoms as you learn to trust her alerts.</p>

  <h2>Veteran Handler Considerations</h2>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Military Terminology & Training Style</strong></summary>
    <p>Many veterans find it helpful to use military terminology for commands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Watch my six" instead of "Behind"</li>
      <li>"On me" instead of "Heel"</li>
      <li>"Check it" or "Clear" for room checking</li>
      <li>"Stand down" for release/break</li>
      <li>"At ease" for settle/relax</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use what feels natural. The terminology matters less than the clarity and consistency.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>The Dog-Handler Bond for Veterans</strong></summary>
    <p>For many veterans, the service dog relationship mirrors military bonds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trust:</strong> You learn to trust her the way you trusted fellow Marines</li>
      <li><strong>Mission-Focused:</strong> You both have a job to do</li>
      <li><strong>Mutual Dependence:</strong> You take care of each other</li>
      <li><strong>Non-Judgmental:</strong> She doesn't care about your struggles, only about helping</li>
      <li><strong>Always There:</strong> Unlike humans who may not understand, she's consistent</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>VA Benefits for Service Dogs</strong></summary>
    <p>As a veteran, you may qualify for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Veterinary health insurance through VA</li>
      <li>Coverage of premiums, copays, deductibles</li>
      <li>Service dog training program access</li>
      <li>Consultation with VA mental health providers</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To apply:</strong> Contact your VA mental health provider and ask about the Service Dog Benefits program. You'll need documentation of your disability and how a service dog mitigates symptoms.</p>
