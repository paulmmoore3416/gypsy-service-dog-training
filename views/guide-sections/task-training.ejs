  <h1>Phase 3: Task-Specific Training (Weeks 17-28)</h1>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>🎯 Objective:</strong> Train Gypsy to perform specific tasks that directly mitigate your disability, building reliability and fluency in each task before moving to public access
  </div>

  <h2>Understanding Task-Specific Training</h2>
  <p>This phase is where Gypsy transforms from a well-trained dog into a true service dog. Each task must be <strong>reliable, consistent, and performed on cue</strong>. Tasks are trained in a specific order, starting with foundation behaviors and building to complex chains.</p>

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>⚠️ Critical Requirement:</strong> Under the ADA, emotional support alone does not qualify as a service dog task. Tasks must be trained behaviors that directly mitigate specific disability symptoms.

      <h3>1. Deep Pressure Therapy (DPT)</h3>
      <span class="difficulty-badge medium">Essential Task</span>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provides calming pressure during anxiety attacks, flashbacks, or emotional distress. The physical weight creates a grounding sensation that reduces anxiety and increases feelings of security.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>What DPT Looks Like</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>On Lap:</strong> Gypsy places her body weight across your lap while you're seated</li>
          <li><strong>On Chest:</strong> While you're lying down, she places her weight on your chest/torso</li>
          <li><strong>Against Side:</strong> Leans full body weight against you while standing or sitting</li>
          <li><strong>On Legs:</strong> Lies across your legs with full body contact</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> She maintains position until released or until you naturally calm (typically 5-15 minutes)</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Training Progression (Weeks 17-20)</strong></summary>

        <h4>Week 17: Foundation - Target Training</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Teach "Touch":</strong> Hold hand out, when she touches with nose, mark and reward</li>
          <li><strong>Add Duration:</strong> She must hold nose to hand for 3 seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Position Target:</strong> Place hand on lap, reward when she brings head to lap</li>
          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> 3-5 sessions daily, 5 minutes each</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Week 18: Building the Position</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Front Paws Up:</strong> Pat lap, lure her to place front paws on your lap, reward immediately</li>
          <li><strong>Add Pressure:</strong> Guide her to lean forward, putting weight on paws. Reward</li>
          <li><strong>Full Body:</strong> Encourage her to bring more of body onto lap. For pitbulls (45-60 lbs), aim for chest/front half</li>
          <li><strong>Hold Position:</strong> Build duration from 5 seconds to 30 seconds</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Week 19: Adding the Cue and Duration</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Name the Behavior:</strong> Just before she positions, say "Lap" or "Pressure"</li>
          <li><strong>Extend Duration:</strong> Build to 2 minutes, then 5 minutes, then 10 minutes</li>
          <li><strong>Variable Reinforcement:</strong> Pet and praise intermittently during hold</li>
          <li><strong>Release Cue:</strong> Teach "Off" or "Release" to end the behavior</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Week 20: Generalization and Refinement</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Different Positions:</strong> Practice with you lying down, sitting on floor, on couch, in chair</li>
          <li><strong>Self-Initiation:</strong> When you show distress signals, she offers DPT without cue</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain Until Calm:</strong> She learns to stay until your breathing/body language signals calm</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple Locations:</strong> Practice in bedroom, living room, outdoor spaces</li>
        </ol>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Pitbull-Specific Considerations</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Perfect Body Size:</strong> At 45-60 lbs, Gypsy provides substantial pressure without being overwhelming</li>
          <li><strong>Velcro Nature:</strong> Pitbulls naturally love close physical contact - this task aligns perfectly with breed tendencies</li>
          <li><strong>Warmth Factor:</strong> Blue nose pitbulls have short coats and run warm - excellent for comfort</li>
          <li><strong>Watch for Over-Enthusiasm:</strong> Ensure she applies pressure gently, not jumping or lunging</li>
          <li><strong>Duration Strength:</strong> Pitbulls excel at sustained focus - she'll naturally hold position well</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Troubleshooting DPT</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>She jumps up too hard:</strong> Go back to paws-only position. Reward gentle placement. Use "Easy" cue</li>
          <li><strong>She won't stay:</strong> Too much duration too soon. Build from 10 seconds, reward heavily</li>
          <li><strong>She's uncomfortable:</strong> Check furniture height - she needs easy access. Use step stool if needed</li>
          <li><strong>Weight distribution hurts:</strong> Train her to position differently - more on legs, less on torso</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>2. Nightmare Interruption / Wake from Sleep</h3>
      <span class="difficulty-badge high">Essential Task</span>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Wakes you from nightmares or night terrors by providing physical contact and alerting, preventing the nightmare from continuing and grounding you in reality.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>How This Task Works</strong></summary>
        <p>Gypsy learns to recognize signs you're having a nightmare (movement, sounds, rapid breathing) and actively wakes you through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pawing at you gently</li>
          <li>Licking your face/hands</li>
          <li>Nudging with nose</li>
          <li>Whining or quiet barking</li>
          <li>Turning on a light (advanced)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>After waking you:</strong> She provides DPT or stays close until you're fully calm and oriented</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Training Progression (Weeks 21-24)</strong></summary>

        <h4>Week 21: Teaching the Wake Behavior</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Simulate Sleep:</strong> Lie in bed with eyes closed during day</li>
          <li><strong>Lure Interaction:</strong> Hold treat in closed hand near face, reward when she paws or nudges</li>
          <li><strong>Add Cue:</strong> Say "Wake me" just before she interacts</li>
          <li><strong>Reward Persistence:</strong> Don't "wake" immediately - reward continued effort</li>
          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> 2-3 times daily at random times</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Week 22: Adding Distress Indicators</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Add Movement:</strong> While "sleeping," move legs or arms restlessly</li>
          <li><strong>Add Sounds:</strong> Make quiet distressed sounds (moans, whimpers)</li>
          <li><strong>Reward Immediate Response:</strong> When she reacts to these cues, massively reward</li>
          <li><strong>Variable Schedule:</strong> Sometimes respond immediately, sometimes require more persistence</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Week 23: Night Training Setup</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Sleeping Arrangement:</strong> Gypsy must sleep in same room (bed, dog bed beside bed, or crate with door open)</li>
          <li><strong>Set Alarms:</strong> Set phone alarm for random times at night (start with just one night/week)</li>
          <li><strong>When Alarm Sounds:</strong> Pretend to have nightmare (movement, sounds)</li>
          <li><strong>Reward Her Wake Attempt:</strong> Keep treats bedside, reward immediately when she wakes you</li>
          <li><strong>Practice Follow-Up:</strong> After she wakes you, cue DPT or "Close" to reinforce full sequence</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Week 24: Real-World Application</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Reduce Simulation:</strong> Stop setting alarms, wait for actual nightmares</li>
          <li><strong>Reinforce Natural Alerts:</strong> If you have nightmare and she responds, heavily reward in morning</li>
          <li><strong>Morning Review:</strong> Keep dream journal - note when she successfully woke you</li>
          <li><strong>Build Confidence:</strong> She learns your actual nightmare signals vs. normal sleep</li>
        </ol>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Pitbull Advantages for This Task</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Alert to Handler Changes:</strong> Pitbulls are highly attuned to their person's emotional state</li>
          <li><strong>Not Easily Discouraged:</strong> Will persist in waking you even if first attempts don't work</li>
          <li><strong>Physical Enough:</strong> Strong enough to effectively wake you without being aggressive</li>
          <li><strong>Protective Nature:</strong> Instinct to "rescue" handler from distress drives this behavior naturally</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Important Considerations</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Safety:</strong> NEVER punish her if she wakes you during normal sleep - this will poison the behavior</li>
          <li><strong>Sleep Quality:</strong> Some handlers find they sleep better knowing dog will wake them from nightmares</li>
          <li><strong>Partner Consideration:</strong> If you share a bed, partner must understand and support this training</li>
          <li><strong>False Alarms:</strong> Initially she may wake you from normal dreams - this is part of learning. Always reward attempt</li>

        <summary><strong>Pitbull Considerations</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Natural Protectors:</strong> Pitbulls have protective instincts without aggression when properly trained</li>
          <li><strong>Physical Presence:</strong> Gypsy's muscular build makes her an effective visual deterrent</li>
          <li><strong>Breed Perception:</strong> Unfortunately, people naturally give pitbulls more space - use this to your advantage</li>
          <li><strong>Must Stay Calm:</strong> Critical that she blocks calmly with neutral body language, never aggressive</li>
          <li><strong>Public Relations:</strong> Gypsy's behavior in this role must be impeccable to counter breed stereotypes</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Variable Reinforcement:</strong> Reward randomly, not every time (builds stronger behavior)</li>
        <li><strong>Real-World Practice:</strong> Practice tasks in actual situations where you'll need them</li>
        <li><strong>Distraction Proofing:</strong> Practice tasks with increasing distractions present</li>
        <li><strong>Chain Behaviors:</strong> Combine tasks (e.g., alert to anxiety → provide DPT → guide to exit)</li>
        <li><strong>Duration Build:</strong> Tasks must last as long as needed, not just a few seconds</li>
        <li><strong>No Cue Needed:</strong> Eventually she recognizes need and offers task spontaneously</li>
      </ol>

  <h2>Multiple Task Management</h2>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Teaching Gypsy to Prioritize Tasks</strong></summary>
    <p>As she learns multiple tasks, she must understand which to offer in different situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anxiety/Panic:</strong> DPT first, then grounding if DPT not working</li>
      <li><strong>Dissociation:</strong> Grounding/nudging first, escalate to more intense behaviors if needed</li>
      <li><strong>Nightmares:</strong> Wake first, then offer DPT</li>
      <li><strong>Crowded Places:</strong> Cover/Block behavior automatically</li>
      <li><strong>Scheduled Times:</strong> Medication reminder</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Training:</strong> Practice scenarios where multiple tasks could apply. Reward the most appropriate choice.</p>

    <details open>
      <summary><strong>Task Proficiency Checklist</strong></summary>
      <p>For EACH task, Gypsy should demonstrate:</p>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>☐ Performs task on cue within 3 seconds</li>
        <li>☐ 90%+ accuracy rate</li>
        <li>☐ Works in at least 5 different environments</li>
        <li>☐ Not distracted by moderate environmental stimuli</li>
        <li>☐ Maintains task until released or situation resolved</li>
        <li>☐ Beginning to offer task spontaneously when appropriate</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Priority Tasks - Must Be Solid</strong></summary>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>☐ Deep Pressure Therapy (DPT)</li>
        <li>☐ Grounding/Tactile Stimulation</li>
        <li>☐ Crowd Control/Cover Behavior</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These three tasks address your primary disability-related needs and must be fluent before public access.</p>

  <h2>Troubleshooting Task Training</h2>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Problem: She performs task at home but not in public</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> This is a generalization issue. Practice the task in progressively more challenging environments. Start in quiet outdoor areas, then gradually increase to busier locations. Increase reward value in public.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Problem: Task falls apart with distractions</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You moved too fast. Return to low-distraction environments and build distraction tolerance gradually using the 3 D's method (Duration, Distance, Distraction - only increase one at a time).</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Problem: She won't hold DPT position long enough</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Duration was increased too quickly. Go back to 30 seconds, reward heavily, then increase by 15-30 second increments. Use higher value rewards for longer durations.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Problem: She's too rough with alert behaviors</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Add an "Easy" or "Gentle" cue. Only reward soft paws/nudges. If she's too rough, ignore and wait for gentler attempt. Pitbulls can be enthusiastic - teaching gentleness is critical.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Problem: She seems stressed by task training</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Sessions may be too long or pressure too high. Keep sessions 5-10 minutes maximum. End on success. Ensure training is fun and heavily rewarded. If she consistently shows stress, consult a professional trainer.</p>
