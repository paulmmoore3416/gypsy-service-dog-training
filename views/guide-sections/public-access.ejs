  <h1>Phase 4: Public Access Training (Weeks 29-40)</h1>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>🎯 Objective:</strong> Prepare Gypsy to work reliably in all public environments while maintaining impeccable behavior and performing her service tasks
  </div>

  <h2>Understanding Public Access Standards</h2>
  <p>Public access is a <strong>privilege, not a right</strong>. Even though you legally have the right to bring Gypsy to public places as a service dog, she must meet high behavioral standards. One bad experience can result in being asked to leave, and poor behavior reflects badly on all service dog teams.</p>

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>⚠️ Critical Standard:</strong> Gypsy must be under control at ALL times. Under the ADA, businesses can remove service dogs that are out of control, aggressive, or not housebroken.
  </div>

  <h2>Public Access Test (PAT) Requirements</h2>

  <section class="pat-section">
    <p>The Public Access Test evaluates whether a service dog is ready for public environments. While not legally required, it's the gold standard for readiness.</p>
