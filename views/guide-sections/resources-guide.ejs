        <h4>What is PAT?</h4>
        <p>Public Access Test - standardized evaluation of service dog's behavior in public. Passing demonstrates readiness for public access work. Not legally required under ADA but often required for certification/insurance.</p>

        <h4>When to Take PAT</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>After 12-18 months of training minimum</li>
          <li>When you're consistently succeeding in public (80%+ reliability)</li>
          <li>Before applying for official certification</li>
          <li>Before long-distance travel or high-stakes public access (weddings, funerals, etc.)</li>

      <h3>5. Legal Resources & Certification</h3>
      <span class="difficulty-badge medium">Protecting Your Rights</span>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand certification options and access legal resources</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>Service Dog Certification/Registration</strong></summary>
        <h4>Legal Reality</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Federal Law (ADA):</strong> Does NOT require certification, registration, or documentation</li>
          <li><strong>You Cannot Be Required:</strong> To show papers, ID, vest, or proof of training</li>
          <li><strong>BUT:</strong> Having documentation makes life easier even though not legally required</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Legitimate Certification Options</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Doctor's Letter (ESA Letter):</strong> From your psychiatrist/therapist stating need for service dog
            <ul><li>Helpful for housing, some situations</li><li>Free from your doctor or ~$100-200 from online services</li></ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Service Dog Registration (USSA, NSARCO, etc.):</strong> Optional registration services
            <ul>
              <li>Cost: $50-200</li>
              <li>Provides: ID card, vest patches, registry listing</li>
              <li>Legitimacy: These are PRIVATE registries, not government. Legal value is minimal but can help in public access scenarios</li>
              <li>Recommended: NSARCO (National Service Animal Registry), USSA (United States Service Dog Registry)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Public Access Test Certification:</strong> From certified evaluator
            <ul><li>Most legitimate "proof" of training</li><li>Shows dog meets behavior standards</li><li>Cost: $100-300</li></ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Fake Registries to Avoid</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Any site that registers dog as service animal WITHOUT proof of training or disability</li>
          <li>Promises like "instant certification" or "register any pet"</li>
          <li>ESA (Emotional Support Animal) registries (ESAs are NOT service dogs, different laws)</li>
