  <h1>Emergency Protocols & Medical Response</h1>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Purpose:</strong> Prepare for medical emergencies, train response tasks, develop disaster preparedness plans, and ensure both you and Gypsy can handle crisis situations safely
  </div>

  <h2>Understanding Emergency Preparedness</h2>

  <p>Service dogs and their handlers face unique emergency challenges. Gypsy must remain calm during your medical crises, know specific response tasks, and be prepared for disasters (fires, evacuations, natural disasters). Additionally, you need plans for Gypsy's medical emergencies. This comprehensive planning can save lives.</p>

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Critical Reality:</strong> Service dogs for PTSD often work with handlers who may experience medical or psychiatric emergencies. Training Gypsy to respond appropriately - staying calm, getting help, or performing specific tasks - is not optional. It's a core component of service dog work.

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Train Gypsy to respond appropriately during your medical or psychiatric emergencies</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>Staying Calm During Handler Crisis</strong></summary>
        <p>The foundation of all emergency response: Gypsy must not panic when you're in distress.</p>

        <h4>Training Protocol</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Desensitization to Distress Cues:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Practice acting "upset" at low intensity (mild breathing changes, slight movement changes)</li>
              <li>Reward Gypsy for remaining calm (sitting, lying down, not jumping on you)</li>
              <li>Gradually increase intensity over weeks</li>
              <li>Practice crying, hyperventilating (controlled), lying on floor, etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Teach "Stay Close":</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Command that means "stay within 3 feet of me but don't interfere"</li>
              <li>Critical if you need her near but not performing DPT</li>
              <li>Practice during simulated episodes</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Practice During Real Episodes:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>If safe, reinforce calm behavior during actual panic attacks/episodes</li>
              <li>Keep treats accessible for marking good responses</li>
              <li>Build history of "Handler distressed = I stay calm, good things happen to me"</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Pitbull Considerations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High Empathy:</strong> Pitbulls are very attuned to handler emotion - may become anxious if you're distressed</li>
          <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Extra desensitization work, practice staying calm when you're upset</li>
          <li><strong>Physical Nature:</strong> May try to "fix" you by licking, pawing, jumping - must channel this into trained tasks</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Get Help/Find Person Task</strong></summary>
        <p>Train Gypsy to find a specific person and alert them that you need help.</p>

        <h4>Training Steps</h4>
        <table class="progression-table">
          <tr><th>Phase</th><th>Training</th><th>Success Criteria</th><th>Timeline</th></tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1. Name Recognition</td>
            <td>Teach Gypsy to go to specific person by name ("Find Sarah")</td>
            <td>Reliably goes to correct person in home</td>
            <td>2-4 weeks</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2. Alert Behavior</td>
            <td>Dog must get person's attention (bark, paw, nose bump)</td>
            <td>Person recognizes dog is alerting</td>
            <td>2-4 weeks</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3. Lead Back</td>
            <td>After alerting, dog leads person back to you</td>
            <td>Completes full sequence reliably</td>
            <td>4-6 weeks</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>4. Distance & Generalization</td>
            <td>Find person in different rooms, different buildings</td>
            <td>Works in various locations</td>
            <td>8-12 weeks</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>Protocol</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Choose 2-3 Target People:</strong> Household members, close neighbors, regular contacts</li>
          <li><strong>Practice with Helper:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>You sit/lie on floor simulating emergency</li>
              <li>Give cue: "Get Sarah!" (or person's name)</li>
              <li>Helper is in nearby room initially</li>
              <li>When Gypsy finds helper, helper rewards profusely then follows Gypsy back to you</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Build Distance:</strong> Helper starts in same room → next room → upstairs → outside → different building</li>
          <li><strong>Add Urgency:</strong> Practice when you're actually upset (with helper's knowledge/preparation)</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Important Notes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This is an advanced task - requires 6+ months training foundation first</li>
          <li>May not work in emergencies when you're alone or helper is unavailable</li>
          <li>Backup: Train "Get Phone" so you can call 911 yourself</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Retrieve Phone/Medical Alert Device</strong></summary>
        <p>More reliable than "get help" - Gypsy brings you communication device.</p>

        <h4>Training Protocol</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Foundation Retrieve:</strong> Gypsy must have solid retrieve with various objects</li>
          <li><strong>Item Discrimination:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Place phone among other items</li>
              <li>Cue: "Get phone" or "Get help"</li>
              <li>Reward when she selects correct item</li>
              <li>Practice until 90%+ accurate</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Location Generalization:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Phone on table, counter, floor, charging station</li>
              <li>Practice in different rooms</li>
              <li>Build reliability across all common phone locations</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Emergency Simulation:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>You on floor in distress</li>
              <li>Give cue weakly (as you might in real emergency)</li>
              <li>Gypsy retrieves phone</li>
              <li>Reward heavily</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Phone Handling</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Protective case prevents damage</li>
          <li><strong>Soft Mouth:</strong> Train gentle carry (no chewing/dropping)</li>
          <li><strong>Backup Device:</strong> Consider dedicated medical alert button Gypsy can retrieve</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2-4 months to reliability if retrieve foundation is solid</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Medical Alert/Panic Button Activation</strong></summary>
        <p>Train Gypsy to physically activate emergency button/device.</p>

        <h4>Equipment Options</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Large Button Medical Alert:</strong> Dog-friendly activation (nose or paw)</li>
          <li><strong>Smart Home Devices:</strong> Some can be trained for dog activation</li>
          <li><strong>Custom Solutions:</strong> Large touchpad connected to alert system</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Training</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Target Training:</strong> Teach nose or paw touch to button</li>
          <li><strong>Add Cue:</strong> "Get help" or "Button" triggers activation</li>
          <li><strong>Pressure Training:</strong> Ensure sufficient pressure to activate (especially for paw activation)</li>
          <li><strong>Generalization:</strong> Practice from various positions (you on floor, couch, bed)</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Considerations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Button must be accessible from where you typically have episodes</li>
          <li>Test activation regularly</li>
          <li>Train strong "leave it" so she doesn't activate accidentally</li>
          <li>Inform monitoring service dog may activate device</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Your Rights:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Service dogs ARE allowed in hospitals, ambulances, emergency rooms</li>
          <li>You CAN have Gypsy with you in most hospital situations</li>
          <li>Exceptions: Surgery, ICU, isolation rooms (infection control)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>But Consider:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hospital stays can be long - is it fair to Gypsy?</li>
          <li>Can she toilet appropriately? (May not have outdoor access for hours)</li>
          <li>Medical procedures may be scary for her</li>
          <li>You may not be able to care for her needs while receiving treatment</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Hospital Plan A: Gypsy Comes With You</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Inform Medical Staff Immediately:</strong> "I have a service dog, she needs to stay with me"</li>
          <li><strong>Provide Care Instructions:</strong> To nurse/family member who can help</li>
          <li><strong>Arrange Potty Breaks:</strong> Every 4-6 hours minimum, family/friend takes her out</li>
          <li><strong>Food/Water:</strong> Emergency contact brings supplies</li>
          <li><strong>During Procedures:</strong> Gypsy can wait in room (secured) or with family in waiting room</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Hospital Plan B: Emergency Contact Takes Gypsy</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Inform First Responders:</strong> "My service dog is home, someone needs to get her"</li>
          <li><strong>Give Contact Info:</strong> Person who has key/can access your home</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency Contact:</strong> Comes to get Gypsy from home, cares for her until you're discharged</li>
          <li><strong>Pre-Arranged:</strong> This person should already know the plan, have practiced care routine</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Practice This</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Have emergency contact watch Gypsy for a weekend</li>
          <li>Ensure they can handle her (walk her, manage any reactivity, etc.)</li>
          <li>Make sure Gypsy is comfortable with this person</li>

        <summary><strong>Common Emergencies & Response</strong></summary>
        <h4>Bloat/GDV (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus)</h4>
        <p><strong>Risk for Gypsy:</strong> Moderate (deep-chested dogs, can affect any breed)</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feed 2-3 smaller meals instead of one large meal</li>
          <li>No exercise 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals</li>
          <li>Slow feeding (puzzle bowls, slow feeders)</li>
          <li>Reduce stress at mealtimes</li>
          <li>Know the signs - catch it early</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Heat Stroke</h4>
        <p><strong>Risk for Gypsy:</strong> Moderate-High (black coat absorbs heat, pitbulls can overheat)</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>No public access work over 80°F without cooling measures</li>
          <li>Access to water always</li>
          <li>Cooling vest for summer work</li>
          <li>Exercise in morning/evening, not midday heat</li>
          <li>NEVER leave in car, even with windows cracked</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Injuries While Working</h4>
        <p><strong>Common: Paw pad cuts/burns</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check paws after working on hot pavement, rough terrain</li>
          <li>Carry dog booties for extreme temperatures</li>
          <li>Learn to bandage a paw</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Dog Attacks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Risk: Service dogs are vulnerable - can't defend themselves, can't run</li>
          <li>Prevention: Maintain distance from unknown dogs, use "get behind" positioning</li>
          <li>If attacked: Your safety first, then protect Gypsy, seek vet care even if injuries seem minor</li>
        </ul>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Evacuation Planning</strong></summary>
        <h4>Plan A: Evacuate Together</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Know Your Routes:</strong> Primary and backup evacuation routes from your area</li>
          <li><strong>Pet-Friendly Shelters:</strong> Research which emergency shelters accept service dogs (most must, but confirm)</li>
          <li><strong>Hotels:</strong> List of pet-friendly hotels along evacuation routes</li>
          <li><strong>Family/Friends:</strong> Out-of-area contacts who could take you both in</li>
          <li><strong>Vehicle Prep:</strong> Keep car with at least 1/2 tank gas during high-risk times</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Plan B: Temporary Separation</h4>
        <p>If you must evacuate but can't take Gypsy immediately (rare, but plan for it):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Leave her with trusted person in safe location</li>
          <li>Sign on door: "PETS INSIDE - [your phone number]"</li>
          <li>Never leave her tied outside or in closed room</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Practice Evacuations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Once a year, practice grabbing go-bags and getting to car within 10 minutes</li>
          <li>Drive an evacuation route so you know it</li>
          <li>Check that Gypsy loads calmly into car when stressed (practice during storms, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Shelter-in-Place Scenarios</strong></summary>
        <h4>Extended Power Outage, Severe Weather, Quarantine</h4>

        <p><strong>Supplies to Have (2-week supply):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Food and water for Gypsy</li>
          <li>Medications</li>
          <li>Manual can opener</li>
          <li>Backup lighting (flashlights, batteries) - Gypsy may be scared of dark/candles</li>
          <li>Potty plan: If can't go outside, disposable pee pads or designated indoor spot</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Maintaining Routine:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>During disasters, keep Gypsy's routine as normal as possible (meals, walks, training)</li>
          <li>Routine provides stability and reduces her stress</li>
          <li>Continue light training sessions - gives her mental stimulation and sense of normalcy</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Your PTSD During Disaster:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disasters can be major PTSD triggers</li>
          <li>Gypsy's tasks still work - use DPT, grounding, etc.</li>
          <li>Having her with you provides emotional support during crisis</li>
          <li>This is why service dog preparedness matters - she helps you cope</li>
        </ul>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Lost Dog Protocol</strong></summary>
        <p>Despite best efforts, dogs can escape during disasters or emergencies.</p>

        <h4>Prevention</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microchip:</strong> Ensure Gypsy is microchipped and registration is current</li>
          <li><strong>ID Tags:</strong> Collar with current phone number (even at home)</li>
          <li><strong>Service Dog Vest:</strong> Helps public recognize she's special needs</li>
          <li><strong>GPS Tracker:</strong> Consider GPS collar tracker (subscription service)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>If Gypsy Goes Missing</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Search Immediately:</strong> First 24 hours are critical</li>
          <li><strong>Alert Neighbors:</strong> Go door-to-door with photo</li>
          <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Post on local lost pet groups, Nextdoor</li>
          <li><strong>Shelters & Vets:</strong> Call all shelters, vet clinics in 50-mile radius</li>
          <li><strong>Flyers:</strong> Post in area, include "SERVICE DOG - HANDLER HAS DISABILITY"</li>
          <li><strong>Don't Give Up:</strong> Dogs have been found weeks or months later</li>
        </ol>

    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Emergency preparedness isn't optional for service dog teams. Create your plans now, before crisis hits. Train emergency response tasks methodically. Prepare go-bags and know your evacuation routes. Most importantly, remember that you and Gypsy are a team - protect each other, plan for each other, and you'll both navigate emergencies more safely.
