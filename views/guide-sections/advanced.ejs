  <h1>Phase 2: Advanced Obedience (Weeks 9-16)</h1>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>🎯 Objective:</strong> Build reliability across environments, add duration to commands, and achieve off-leash control in preparation for service work
  </div>

  <h2>Training Philosophy for This Phase</h2>
  <p>Foundation commands are now established in your home environment. This phase focuses on <strong>generalization</strong> (commands work everywhere), <strong>distraction proofing</strong> (commands work despite distractions), and <strong>duration building</strong> (commands last as long as needed). This is where Gypsy transitions from "knowing" commands to truly reliable obedience.</p>

        <summary><strong>Pitbull-Specific Considerations</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Excitement Management:</strong> Pitbulls get excited in new places. Start each session with 5-10 minutes of decompression walking before asking for commands</li>
          <li><strong>Public Perception:</strong> Be aware that people may react negatively to Gypsy's breed. Stay calm and confident - your energy affects her behavior</li>
          <li><strong>Leash Reactivity Prevention:</strong> Keep sessions short and positive. End BEFORE she becomes overstimulated</li>
          <li><strong>High Energy Release:</strong> Exercise her moderately before training sessions in new environments</li>
        </ul>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Training Protocol</strong></summary>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Arrival Protocol:</strong> Let Gypsy observe the new environment for 2-3 minutes without asking for commands</li>
          <li><strong>Easy Wins First:</strong> Start with her strongest command (usually "Sit") to build confidence</li>
          <li><strong>Short Sessions:</strong> 5-7 minutes maximum in new environments initially</li>
          <li><strong>High Value Rewards:</strong> Use better treats in more challenging environments</li>
          <li><strong>Gradual Difficulty:</strong> Don't jump from home to busy park - use intermediate locations</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple Visits:</strong> Return to each location 3-5 times before moving to next difficulty level</li>

          <li><strong>Variable Return:</strong> Sometimes return at 5 seconds, sometimes 30 seconds (builds unpredictability)</li>

          <li><strong>If she breaks with distractions:</strong> Distraction too challenging. Use easier distractions first</li>
          <li><strong>Pitbull Consideration:</strong> Velcro dogs like pitbulls find distance/out-of-sight difficult. Build gradually with high value rewards</li>

  <h2>Troubleshooting Common Week 9-16 Challenges</h2>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Problem: Commands fall apart in new environments</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You progressed to difficult environments too quickly. Return to easier locations and build more repetitions. Rule of thumb: 5-7 successful sessions at current level before advancing.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Problem: Gypsy is reactive to other dogs</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> This is common in pitbulls around 18 months. Work with a professional on BAT (Behavior Adjustment Training). Increase distance from trigger, reward calm observation. Never punish reactivity.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Problem: Stays break constantly</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You're increasing difficulty too fast. Go back to short duration, close distance, no distractions. Build ONE variable at a time. Ensure she's successful 90% of the time.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Problem: Heel falls apart around distractions</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Practice "attention heel" - reward every time she looks up at you while heeling. Make yourself more interesting than environment. Use higher value rewards.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Problem: Gypsy seems stressed in new environments</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Respect her communication. Some dogs need more time. Spend entire first visit just sitting and observing. Let her tell you when she's ready to work. Never force.</p>
