    <strong>🎯 Purpose:</strong> Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common behavioral challenges specific to pitbulls, service dog training, and 18-month-old females
  </div>

  <h2>Understanding Behavioral Challenges</h2>

  <p>Behavioral issues are normal during training and don't mean failure. Most challenges can be resolved with proper technique, patience, and understanding of the underlying cause. This section addresses issues specific to Gypsy's age, breed, and role.</p>

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>⚠️ Important Principle:</strong> Behavior is communication. If Gypsy is exhibiting unwanted behavior, she's telling you something. Our job is to understand what and address the root cause, not just suppress the symptom.

      <h3>1. Dog Reactivity / Dog Selectivity</h3>
      <span class="difficulty-badge high">Common in Pitbulls 12-24 Months</span>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p><strong>What It Looks Like:</strong> Gypsy lunges, barks, whines, or fixates on other dogs. Body stiffens, hackles may raise, intense staring.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>Why This Happens in Pitbulls</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Breed History:</strong> Some pitbulls become dog-selective as they mature (18 months is prime age)</li>
          <li><strong>Social Maturity:</strong> Adolescent dogs often lose puppy friendliness</li>
          <li><strong>Frustration:</strong> May want to greet but leash prevents it (barrier frustration)</li>
          <li><strong>Fear:</strong> Bad experience with another dog in the past</li>
          <li><strong>Arousal:</strong> General excitement that manifests as reactivity</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For Service Work:</strong> Gypsy doesn't need to like other dogs, but she MUST be neutral and non-reactive. Dog reactivity is a major public access concern.</p>

        <summary><strong>Training Protocol: Behavior Adjustment Training (BAT)</strong></summary>
        <h4>Step-by-Step BAT Method:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Find Threshold Distance:</strong> How far away can she see a dog and remain calm? (Might be 50+ feet initially)</li>
          <li><strong>Work Sub-Threshold:</strong> Stay at distance where she notices dog but doesn't react</li>
          <li><strong>Reward Calm Observation:</strong> Mark and reward any moment she looks at dog calmly
            <ul>
              <li>Look at dog → look back at you = massive reward</li>
              <li>Look at dog → relaxed body = reward</li>
              <li>Look at dog → choose to sniff ground or look away = huge reward</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Gradually Decrease Distance:</strong> Over multiple sessions (weeks/months), slowly work closer
            <ul>
              <li>Only decrease distance when she's consistently calm at current distance</li>
              <li>If she reacts, you went too close - increase distance</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Change Her Emotional Response:</strong> Goal is "I see a dog" = "Good things happen to me"
            <ul>
              <li>Dog appears → treats flow continuously</li>
              <li>Dog disappears → treats stop</li>
              <li>She learns: dogs predict good stuff</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Practice Setup:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Controlled Exposure:</strong> Practice at dog parks (outside fence), pet stores (parking lot), vet office (far end of parking lot)</li>
          <li><strong>Helper Dog:</strong> Enlist friend with calm, neutral dog for setups</li>
          <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Short sessions (5-10 minutes) to prevent frustration</li>
          <li><strong>High-Value Rewards:</strong> Use chicken, steak, cheese - best treats only for this</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Management Strategies</strong></summary>
        <h4>While Training is in Progress:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Create Distance:</strong> Cross street, step behind cars, turn and walk away</li>
          <li><strong>Body Blocking:</strong> Step in front of her line of sight to break visual</li>
          <li><strong>Engagement Games:</strong> Play "find it" (toss treats in grass) when dog approaches</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency U-Turn:</strong> "Let's go!" in happy voice, turn and walk fast away, reward heavily</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid Greetings:</strong> Until reactivity is resolved, no on-leash greetings with other dogs</li>
          <li><strong>Off-Peak Hours:</strong> Walk during times with fewer dogs around</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Equipment:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Front-Clip Harness:</strong> Gives you more control, reduces pulling power</li>
          <li><strong>Double-Leash:</strong> Attach to both collar and harness for security</li>
          <li><strong>6-Foot Leash:</strong> Not flexi-lead - need control</li>
          <li><strong>Treat Pouch:</strong> Rewards immediately accessible</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>"Look At That" (LAT) Game</strong></summary>
        <p>Excellent for building calm observation skills:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Setup:</strong> From safe distance, let her notice a dog</li>
          <li><strong>Mark:</strong> The instant she looks at the dog, mark "Yes!"</li>
          <li><strong>Reward:</strong> She turns back to you for treat</li>
          <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Build the pattern: Look at dog → Look at handler → Get reward</li>
          <li><strong>Add Cue:</strong> Eventually "Look" becomes a redirect cue you can use</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> She learns to check in with you when she sees a dog rather than fixating.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>When to Seek Professional Help</strong></summary>
        <div class="alert alert-danger">
          <p><strong>Seek immediate professional help if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reactivity is getting worse despite training</li>
            <li>She has injured another dog or shown true aggression (not just noise)</li>
            <li>You feel unsafe handling her around other dogs</li>
            <li>Reactivity is preventing your ability to complete service dog training</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Find:</strong> Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) or Veterinary Behaviorist (DACVB) with experience in reactivity and service dogs</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Service Dog Specific Considerations</strong></summary>
        <p>For service work, Gypsy must achieve:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Neutral Body Language:</strong> Sees dog, acknowledges, moves on</li>
          <li><strong>No Vocalization:</strong> No barking, whining, or growling</li>
          <li><strong>Maintains Work:</strong> Can perform tasks even with dogs nearby</li>
          <li><strong>Close Proximity Tolerance:</strong> Must handle 6-10 feet minimum (for passing in aisles)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Resolving reactivity can take 3-6 months of consistent work. Factor this into your training timeline.</p>

      <h3>2. Jumping on People</h3>
      <span class="difficulty-badge medium">Impulse Control Issue</span>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p><strong>What It Looks Like:</strong> Gypsy jumps on you, visitors, or strangers during greetings or when excited.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>Why Pitbulls Jump</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enthusiasm:</strong> Pitbulls are naturally enthusiastic greeters</li>
          <li><strong>Reinforcement History:</strong> Jumping has likely been rewarded (attention, petting, excitement)</li>
          <li><strong>Proximity Seeking:</strong> She wants to be close to your face</li>
          <li><strong>Energy Level:</strong> High arousal leads to jumping</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> For service dogs, jumping is absolutely unacceptable. In public, one jump could result in injury, damage to property, or loss of access rights.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Prevention Protocol</strong></summary>
        <h4>The "Four Paws on Floor" Rule:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>All Four Paws:</strong> She only gets what she wants (attention, treats, petting) when all four paws are on floor</li>
          <li><strong>Turn Away:</strong> The instant she jumps, immediately turn your back, cross arms, no eye contact</li>
          <li><strong>Wait:</strong> Ignore completely until all four paws are down</li>
          <li><strong>Immediate Reward:</strong> The second four paws touch floor, turn and reward/praise</li>
          <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> EVERYONE who interacts with her must follow this rule</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Alternative Behavior: Teach "Sit for Greeting"</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Approach = Sit Cue:</strong> Whenever you approach her, cue "Sit" before she can jump</li>
          <li><strong>Reward Sitting:</strong> Lavish praise and petting only while sitting</li>
          <li><strong>Stand = Attention Ends:</strong> If she stands, attention immediately stops</li>
          <li><strong>Build Duration:</strong> Gradually increase how long she must sit before greeting</li>
          <li><strong>Generalize:</strong> Practice with different people in different locations</li>
        </ol>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Visitor Protocol</strong></summary>
        <h4>Training Guests to Help:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Prepare Visitors:</strong> Text ahead: "I'm training Gypsy not to jump. Please ignore her completely until she sits."</li>
          <li><strong>Leash Control:</strong> Keep her on leash during arrivals until jumping is resolved</li>
          <li><strong>Pre-Arrival Cue:</strong> When doorbell rings, immediately cue "Sit-Stay"</li>
          <li><strong>Guest Entry:</strong> Guest enters and ignores her (no eye contact, touch, or talk)</li>
          <li><strong>Waiting Game:</strong> Eventually she'll sit from frustration - THEN guest greets</li>
          <li><strong>Reset if Jumping:</strong> If she jumps on guest, guest turns back, you reset with "Sit"</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Advanced: Greeting Strangers in Public</h4>
        <p>For service work, she should not greet strangers at all, but the protocol if someone approaches:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Pre-Emptive Sit:</strong> You cue "Sit" before stranger reaches you</li>
          <li><strong>Body Block:</strong> Position yourself between Gypsy and person</li>
          <li><strong>Set Boundary:</strong> "She's working, please don't pet her"</li>
          <li><strong>If They Insist:</strong> "She can only be petted while sitting"</li>
          <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You release her from sit after greeting, not the person</li>
        </ol>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Pitbull-Specific Considerations</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strength:</strong> At 50+ lbs, Gypsy's jumps can knock people over - especially dangerous with elderly</li>
          <li><strong>Public Perception:</strong> Pitbull jumping is more frightening to public than other breeds</li>
          <li><strong>Enthusiasm Threshold:</strong> Pitbulls stay excited longer - allow 5-10 minutes of ignoring before expecting calm</li>
          <li><strong>Physical Redirection:</strong> Use leash to prevent jumping, never knee or push (can trigger play/wrestling)</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>She jumps anyway:</strong> Your timing may be off. Reward must happen within 1 second of four paws down</li>
          <li><strong>Gets worse initially:</strong> Normal. She's trying harder to get what worked before (extinction burst)</li>
          <li><strong>Only jumps on some people:</strong> Those people are inconsistently enforcing rules. Address with them</li>
          <li><strong>Jumps when you're holding leash:</strong> Practice greeting while holding leash very short (prevents physical success)</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>3. Pulling on Leash</h3>
      <span class="difficulty-badge medium">Common Pitbull Challenge</span>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p><strong>What It Looks Like:</strong> Gypsy pulls forward, leash is tight, you're being dragged around the neighborhood.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>Why Pitbulls Pull</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Physical Power:</strong> Pitbulls are incredibly strong for their size</li>
          <li><strong>High Drive:</strong> Excited about exploring, following scents, getting places</li>
          <li><strong>History of Reinforcement:</strong> Pulling has "worked" - she gets where she wants to go</li>
          <li><strong>Natural Pace:</strong> Her natural walking pace may be faster than yours</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of Training:</strong> Was never taught that loose leash = forward progress</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>The "Be a Tree" Method</strong></summary>
        <h4>Basic Protocol:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Leash Tightens:</strong> Stop moving immediately</li>
          <li><strong>Become a Tree:</strong> Plant feet, don't move, don't pull back</li>
          <li><strong>Wait:</strong> Don't move until leash has slack</li>
          <li><strong>Mark & Move:</strong> When leash loosens, say "Yes!" and immediately resume walking</li>
          <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Every single time leash tightens, stop</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>What She Learns:</h4>
        <p>"Pulling makes us stop. Loose leash makes us go. I control the walk pace by keeping leash loose."</p>

        <h4>Pro Tips:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Patience Required:</strong> First walks may take 30 minutes to go 100 feet</li>
          <li><strong>Consistency Critical:</strong> If you let her pull "just this once," you reset all progress</li>
          <li><strong>Practice in Low-Distraction:</strong> Backyard first, then front yard, then neighborhood</li>
          <li><strong>Shorter Walks Initially:</strong> Better to have 5-minute successful walk than 30-minute pulling battle</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>The "300 Peck" Method (Alternative)</strong></summary>
        <p>For dogs who don't respond to "Be a Tree":</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Leash Tightens:</strong> Immediately change direction 180 degrees</li>
          <li><strong>Walk Away:</strong> Walk briskly in opposite direction</li>
          <li><strong>She Follows:</strong> Reward when she catches up with loose leash</li>
          <li><strong>Resume Original Direction:</strong> After a few seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Every time she pulls, turn around</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>What She Learns:</strong> Pulling doesn't get her anywhere. Paying attention to you gets her where she wants to go.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Engagement Walking</strong></summary>
        <h4>Making Yourself More Interesting Than Environment:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Bring High-Value Treats:</strong> Walking is now a training session</li>
          <li><strong>Frequent Rewards:</strong> Every 5-10 steps of loose leash, reward at your side</li>
          <li><strong>Attention Checks:</strong> Reward every time she looks up at you while walking</li>
          <li><strong>Unpredictability:</strong> Change pace, do sudden turns, walk backwards - keep her focused on you</li>
          <li><strong>Name Game:</strong> Say her name, she looks at you, reward, keep walking</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Goal:</h4>
        <p>She learns that walking near you (not at the end of leash) is where good stuff happens.</p>

        </table>

        <h4>Recommendation for Gypsy:</h4>
        <p>Start with front-clip harness to manage pulling while you train loose-leash walking. Transition to flat collar or martingale once pulling is resolved.</p>

        <h4>Avoid:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Retractable Leashes:</strong> Teach pulling, inconsistent feedback, dangerous</li>
          <li><strong>Choke Chains:</strong> Can damage trachea, unnecessary for training</li>
          <li><strong>Prong/Pinch Collars:</strong> Not appropriate for service dogs, can create negative associations</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Realistic Timeline</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Many stops, slow progress, testing boundaries</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Starting to understand loose leash = forward movement</li>
          <li><strong>Week 5-8:</strong> Loose leash walking in low-distraction environments</li>
          <li><strong>Week 9-12:</strong> Generalizing to more distracting environments</li>
          <li><strong>Week 13+:</strong> Reliable loose leash in most situations</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key:</strong> Consistency is everything. One person letting her pull sets back progress significantly.</p>

      <h3>4. Mouthing / Play Biting</h3>
      <span class="difficulty-badge low">Normal but Must Stop</span>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p><strong>What It Looks Like:</strong> Gypsy puts her mouth on your hands, arms, or clothing during play or excitement.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>Understanding Mouthing</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Normal Behavior:</strong> Dogs explore world with mouths</li>
          <li><strong>Play Style:</strong> Pitbulls often mouth during play - it's how they played with littermates</li>
          <li><strong>Arousal:</strong> More likely when excited or overstimulated</li>
          <li><strong>Attention Seeking:</strong> If it gets reaction from you, it continues</li>
          <li><strong>Not Aggression:</strong> Mouthing ≠ biting. Soft mouth, playful context</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why It Must Stop:</strong> Service dogs can NEVER mouth humans. Even gentle mouthing looks bad in public and could be misinterpreted as aggression, especially with a pitbull.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Elimination Protocol</strong></summary>
        <h4>Method 1: Remove Reinforcement</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Teeth Touch Skin:</strong> Immediately say "Ouch!" in high-pitched voice</li>
          <li><strong>Withdraw Completely:</strong> Stand up, turn away, cross arms</li>
          <li><strong>Ignore for 30 Seconds:</strong> No eye contact, no talking, no touching</li>
          <li><strong>Resume:</strong> After 30 seconds, engage again</li>
          <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Every single time teeth touch skin</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Method 2: Redirect to Appropriate Object</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Mouthing Begins:</strong> Immediately offer appropriate toy</li>
          <li><strong>Reward Toy Interaction:</strong> Praise and play when she mouths toy instead of you</li>
          <li><strong>Keep Toys Accessible:</strong> Always have toy available during play</li>
          <li><strong>Teach "Get Your Toy":</strong> She learns to get toy when excited</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Method 3: Timeout</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Mouthing Happens:</strong> Immediately end interaction</li>
          <li><strong>Leave Room:</strong> Walk out, close door/baby gate</li>
          <li><strong>30-60 Second Timeout:</strong> Return after brief period</li>
          <li><strong>Resume Calmly:</strong> Only interact if she's calm</li>
        </ol>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Teaching "Gentle" Cue</strong></summary>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Offer Treat:</strong> Hold treat in closed fist</li>
          <li><strong>Wait for Gentle:</strong> Don't open hand if she's being rough</li>
          <li><strong>Mark Gentle:</strong> When she licks or gently nuzzles, say "Gentle" and open hand</li>
          <li><strong>Reward:</strong> She gets treat for gentle interaction</li>
          <li><strong>Generalize:</strong> Use "Gentle" cue in all situations requiring soft mouth</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong> Taking treats, taking objects, any mouth interaction must be preceded by "Gentle"</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Managing Arousal Levels</strong></summary>
        <p>Mouthing often happens when arousal is too high:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Recognize Threshold:</strong> Learn her arousal signs (faster breathing, wider eyes, mouthing attempts)</li>
          <li><strong>End Before Threshold:</strong> Stop play/interaction before she gets to mouthing stage</li>
          <li><strong>Calm Down Cue:</strong> Teach "Settle" or "Easy" to lower arousal</li>
          <li><strong>Exercise First:</strong> Well-exercised dogs have better impulse control</li>
          <li><strong>Mental Stimulation:</strong> Tired brain = calmer dog</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>What NOT to Do</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>❌ Don't:</strong> Hit, slap, or tap her nose/muzzle (damages trust, can create defensive aggression)</li>
          <li><strong>❌ Don't:</strong> Use physical punishment (especially with pitbulls - breaks bond)</li>
          <li><strong>❌ Don't:</strong> Yell or get angry (she'll think you're playing)</li>
          <li><strong>❌ Don't:</strong> Continue playing after mouthing (rewards the behavior)</li>
          <li><strong>❌ Don't:</strong> Wrestle or play roughly (encourages mouthy play)</li>
        </ul>

        <summary><strong>Service Dog Paradox</strong></summary>
        <p>Service dog training creates a paradox:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>We Want:</strong> Strong bond, attentiveness, desire to be near you</li>
          <li><strong>We Also Need:</strong> Ability to be alone without distress</li>
          <li><strong>Pitbull Factor:</strong> Naturally velcro dogs, strong bonding tendency</li>
          <li><strong>Your Situation:</strong> She's likely with you 24/7, intensifying bond</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Balance:</strong> She should be confident being alone while deeply bonded when together.</p>

        <summary><strong>Building Independence Protocol</strong></summary>
        <h4>Systematic Desensitization:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Practice very brief separations while home
            <ul>
              <li>Go to bathroom, close door, return immediately</li>
              <li>Move to different room for 30 seconds</li>
              <li>Step outside door for 10 seconds</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>No Drama:</strong> Don't make departures/arrivals exciting
            <ul>
              <li>No goodbye rituals</li>
              <li>No big hello when returning</li>
              <li>Matter-of-fact: you leave, you return, no big deal</li>

          </li>
          <li><strong>Gradual Duration Increase:</strong> Build up slowly

              <li>Week 2: 2 to 5 minutes</li>
              <li>Week 3: 5 to 15 minutes</li>

        </ol>

        <h4>Place Training for Independence:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Designate "Place":</strong> Dog bed, mat, crate</li>
          <li><strong>Teach Command:</strong> "Place" = go to spot and lie down</li>
          <li><strong>Build Duration:</strong> She stays on place even when you move around</li>
          <li><strong>Reward Calm:</strong> Periodically reward her for staying put</li>
          <li><strong>Practice Daily:</strong> While you cook, watch TV, work - she's on place</li>

      <h3>6. Resource Guarding</h3>
      <span class="difficulty-badge high">Serious - Requires Immediate Address</span>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p><strong>What It Looks Like:</strong> Gypsy stiffens, growls, snaps, or bites when someone approaches her food, toys, sleeping spot, or you.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>Understanding Resource Guarding</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Normal Behavior:</strong> Most dogs have some resource guarding instinct</li>
          <li><strong>Survival Instinct:</strong> Protect valuable resources from being taken</li>
          <li><strong>Learned Behavior:</strong> Often worsened by people taking things away</li>
          <li><strong>Service Dog Issue:</strong> ANY resource guarding disqualifies from service work until resolved</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Warning Signs (Escalating):</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Body stiffens over resource</li>
          <li>Eats faster when you approach</li>
          <li>Side-eye ("whale eye") watching you</li>
          <li>Low growl</li>
          <li>Lip curl, showing teeth</li>
          <li>Snap (air bite, not contact)</li>
          <li>Bite</li>

          <p><strong>DO NOT:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>❌ Punish growling (removes warning system, dog may bite without warning)</li>
            <li>❌ Take resources away forcefully ("I'm the alpha" mentality - outdated and dangerous)</li>
            <li>❌ Stare down or physically challenge over resource</li>
            <li>❌ Continue approach if she's showing warning signs</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Why:</strong> These methods can escalate to dangerous aggression and destroy trust.</p>

        <summary><strong>Treatment Protocol: Trading Game</strong></summary>
        <h4>Teaching "Human Approach = Good Things Happen":</h4>

        <h5>Level 1: Food Bowl</h5>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Start with Empty Bowl:</strong> Set empty bowl down</li>
          <li><strong>Add Food:</strong> Drop handful of kibble in bowl while she's eating</li>
          <li><strong>Walk Away:</strong> Don't hover</li>
          <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Approach = more food appears</li>
          <li><strong>Build Duration:</strong> Stand closer for longer before adding food</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Level 2: High-Value Addition</h5>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Regular Meal:</strong> She's eating her normal food</li>
          <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Walk toward bowl</li>
          <li><strong>Drop Upgrade:</strong> Drop piece of chicken or cheese in bowl</li>
          <li><strong>Leave:</strong> Walk away</li>
          <li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Your approach makes her meal better, not worse</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Level 3: Trade Up</h5>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Give Low-Value Item:</strong> She has toy or chew</li>
          <li><strong>Offer Trade:</strong> Show her something better (treat, special toy)</li>
          <li><strong>Say "Trade":</strong> When she drops item, immediately give better thing</li>
          <li><strong>Give Back Original:</strong> After she eats treat, return original item</li>
          <li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Giving things up means good stuff comes, and she gets it back</li>
        </ol>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Prevention Strategies</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feed in Safe Space:</strong> Location where she won't be bothered</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple Resources:</strong> Several toys available, reduces competition</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid Triggers:</strong> Don't create situations that trigger guarding while training</li>
          <li><strong>Teach "Drop It" & "Leave It":</strong> Foundation for releasing resources</li>
          <li><strong>Hand Feeding:</strong> Some meals hand-fed to associate hands with providing, not taking</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Service Dog Specific</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>Zero Tolerance Standard:</strong> Service dogs cannot show any resource guarding in public. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Guarding handler (you) from other people approaching</li>
          <li>Guarding handler's belongings (purse, bag, seat)</li>
          <li>Guarding work area (under table at restaurant)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Testing:</strong> Before public access certification, test with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stranger approaches while she's lying near your bag</li>
          <li>Someone reaches toward item near her</li>
          <li>Person approaches while she's "working" (DPT, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If Guarding Persists:</strong> Consult certified behavior consultant (CBCC-KA, CDBC) immediately. This can disqualify her from service work if not resolved.</p>
